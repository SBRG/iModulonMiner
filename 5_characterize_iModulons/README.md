# Step 5: Characterize iModulons

This folder contains five Jupyter notebooks that outline the following characterization steps:
1. Creating a gene annotation table
2. Performing regulon, KEGG, and GO enrichments
3. Curating enrichments and iModulon thresholds
4. Searching for motifs
5. Creating an iModulonDB dashboard

To run these notebooks, you can either install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or install all requirements listed in the [`environment.yml`](../environment.yml) file on the main page, or use a pre-existing docker container.

## Running the docker container
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run the following code in terminal
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 avsastry/modulome-workflow:v1.0
```
3. Select the third link in terminal (starts with 127.0.0.1)
4. Navigate to the `5_characterize_iModulons` folder and open the notebooks. Any changes made here will not be saved outside of the container.

## Mounting local files in the Docker container
If you want to edit and save files in the docker container, replace the above command with the following:
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v <target-path>:/home/jovyan/work avsastry/modulome-workflow:v1.0
```
The above commands will mount the files in your local `<target-path>` to `/home/jovyan/work` in the Docker container. These files are editable, and changes made in the docker container will be reflected on your own machine. Only subfolders and files within `<target-path>` can be accessed by the container, so it is recommended to input the root folder of this repository as the `<target-path>`.

For more options, such as changing the default username, changing the port, or granting root access, see the Jupyter Docker Stacks [Feature page](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/common.html)

## Eukaryotic functions
Plotting chromosomes and reading gff files for yeast are functions displayed in the eukaryotic_functions notebook. This notebook requires PyModulon 1.0.0 or later in order for functions to be installed correctly. See the [pymodulon github](https://github.com/SBRG/pymodulon) for information on installing this version of the package.
